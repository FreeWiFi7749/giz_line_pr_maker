# PR Maker Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and update the values

# For local development only:
# Backend API URL (used by server-side routes)
API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# API Key for backend authentication (used by server-side routes)
API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Cloudflare Workers Deployment Notes:
# =====================================
# API calls are proxied through server-side routes to keep API_KEY secure.
# The client never sees the API_KEY - it's only used server-side.
#
# 1. API_URL is set in wrangler.jsonc (public, non-sensitive)
#    Default: https://api.prmaker.frwi.tech
#
# 2. API_KEY must be set as a secret (sensitive):
#    npx wrangler secret put API_KEY
#
# 3. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
#    npm run build && npx wrangler deploy
